# Matlab
Packages either written in, or callable from, Matlab.

    Netlab: contains code for feedforward neural networks (MLPs), Gaussian processes, mixtures of Gaussians, etc. Very well documented (comes with a book).
    Spider, new object oriented matlab machine learning library, with an emphasis on kernel-based and other discriminative methods
    BNT: (Bayes net toolbox), contains code for inference and learning in graphical models (emphasis on discrete states and directed graphs)
    MATBUGS: a matlab interface to WinBugs, a popular program for Gibbs sampling on hierarchical Bayesian models.
    VIBES: a Java program (with matlab interface) for (mean field) variational message passing on (conjugate) hierarchical Bayesian models.
    MCMCstuff: MCMC for MLPs, Gaussian processes, etc.
    FBM tools for matlab, a matlab interface to Software for Flexible Bayesian Modeling and Markov Chain Sampling by Radford Neal. 

# Java

    Weka, a Java library (with heavy GUI emphasis) for various kinds of classifiers and discrete Bayes nets
    Yet Another Learning Environment, emphasis on data mining (compatible with Weka)
    Mallet, code for statistical natural language processing (including 1D CRFs). 

# Other

    Graphical model software, a comparative list
    VFML, VFML (Very Fast Machine Learning) library for mining very large databases and data streams (in C)
    CREST, kernel based classification and regression (in python)
    Radford Neal's MCMC sofware (in C) for Bayesian neural networks, mixture models, Gaussian processes, etc.
    Nodelib C++ library for neural nets
    Torch C++ machine learning library (neural nets, SVMs, HMMs, etc.)
