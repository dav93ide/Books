>&#13;   All streams are registered as resources when they are created.  This ensures
   that they will be properly cleaned up even if there is some fatal error.
   All of the filesystem functions in PHP operate on streams resources - that
   means that your extensions can accept regular PHP file pointers as
   parameters to, and return streams from their functions.
   The streams API makes this process as painless as possible:

>&#13;   Since streams are automatically cleaned up, it's tempting to think that we can get
   away with being sloppy programmers and not bother to close the streams when we
   are done with them.  Although such an approach might work, it is not a good idea
   for a number of reasons: streams hold locks on system resources while they are
   open, so leaving a file open after you have finished with it could prevent other
   processes from accessing it.  If a script deals with a large number of files,
   the accumulation of the resources used, both in terms of memory and the
   sheer number of open files, can cause web server requests to fail.  Sounds
   bad, doesn't it?  The streams API includes some magic that helps you to
   keep your code clean - if a stream is not closed by your code when it should
   be, you will find some helpful debugging information in you web server error
   log.

    Always use a debug build of PHP when developing an extension
    (<VAR
CLASS="option"
>--enable-debug</VAR
> when running configure), as a lot of
    effort has been made to warn you about memory and stream leaks.

>&#13;   In some cases, it is useful to keep a stream open for the duration of a request,
   to act as a log or trace file for example.  Writing the code to safely clean up
   such a stream is not difficult, but it's several lines of code that are not
   strictly needed.  To save yourself the trouble of writing the code, you
   can mark a stream as being OK for auto cleanup.  What this means is
   that the streams API will not emit a warning when it is time to auto-cleanup
   a stream.  To do this, you can use <B
CLASS="function"
>php_stream_auto_cleanup()</B
>.
