      On Windows machines, you can simply use the included ODBC support
      and the correct ODBC driver.
     </P
><P
>&#13;      On Unix machines, you can use the Sybase-CT driver
      to access Microsoft SQL Servers because they are (at
      least mostly) protocol-compatible. Sybase has made a
      <A

      libraries for Linux systems</A

      systems, you need to contact Sybase for the correct libraries.

      Yes. You already have all the tools you need if you are running
      entirely under Windows 9x/Me, or NT/2000, where you can use
      ODBC and Microsoft's ODBC drivers for Microsoft Access databases.
     </P
><P
>&#13;      If you are running PHP on a Unix box and want to talk to MS Access
      on a Windows box you will need Unix ODBC drivers.
      <A
HREF="http://www.openlinksw.com/"
TARGET="_top"
>OpenLink Software</A
> has Unix-based
      ODBC drivers that can do this. There is a free pilot program where you
      can download an evaluation copy that doesn't expire and prices start at
      $675 for the commercial supported version.
     </P
><P
>&#13;      Another alternative is to use an SQL server that has
      Windows ODBC drivers and use that to store the data, which you can
      then access from Microsoft Access (using ODBC) and PHP (using the
      built in drivers), or to use an intermediary file format that Access
      and PHP both understand, such as flat files or dBase databases.

>&#13;        Using another database as an intermediary is not a good idea, when you can
        use ODBC from PHP straight to your database - i.e. with OpenLink's drivers. If
        you do need to use an intermediary file format, OpenLink have now released
        Virtuoso (a virtual database engine) for NT, Linux and other Unix platforms.

      Most likely what has happened is, PHP 4 was compiled with the <VAR
CLASS="option"
>--with-mysql</VAR
> option, without specifying the
      path to MySQL. This means PHP is using its built-in MySQL client
      library. If your system is running applications, such as PHP 3 as a
      concurrent Apache module, or auth-mysql, that use other
      versions of MySQL clients, then there is a conflict between the two
      differing versions of those clients.
     </P
><P
>&#13;      Recompiling PHP 4, and adding the path to MySQL to the flag,
      '<A
HREF="ref.mysql.html#mysql.configure"

>'
      usually solves the problem.

      PHP 5 no longer bundles MySQL client libraries, what does this mean to
      me?  Can I still use MySQL with PHP?  I try to use MySQL and get

      Yes.  There will always be MySQL support in PHP of one kind or
      another.  The only change in PHP 5 is that we are no longer bundling
      the client library itself.  Some reasons in no particular order:
     </P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>&#13;        Most systems these days already have the client library installed.
       </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;        Given the above, having multiple versions of the library can get
        messy.  For example, if you link mod_auth_mysql against one version
        and PHP against another, and then enable both in Apache, you get a
        nice fat crash.  Also, the bundled library didn't always play well
        with the installed server version.  The most obvious symptom of this
        being disagreement over where to find the mysql.socket Unix domain
        socket file.
       </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;        Maintenance was somewhat lax and it was falling further and further
        behind the released version.
       </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;        Future versions of the library are under the GPL and thus we don't
        have an upgrade path since we cannot bundle a GPL'ed library in a
        BSD/Apache-style licensed project.  A clean break in PHP 5 seemed
        like the best option.

><P
>&#13;      This won't actually affect that many people.  Unix users, at least the
      ones who know what they are doing, tend to always build PHP against
      their system's libmyqlclient library simply by adding the <VAR
CLASS="option"
>--with-mysql=/usr</VAR
> option
      when building PHP.  Windows users may enable the extension
      <TT
CLASS="filename"
>php_mysql.dll</TT
> inside <TT
CLASS="filename"
>php.ini</TT
>.
      For more details, see the <A
HREF="ref.mysql.html"
>MySQL Reference</A
>
      for installation instructions. Also, be sure
      <TT
CLASS="filename"
>libmysql.dll</TT
> is available to the systems PATH.
      For more details on how, read the FAQ on
      <A
HREF="missing-stuff.html#faq.installation.addtopath"
>setting up the Windows
      systems PATH</A
>.  Because <TT
CLASS="filename"
>libmysql.dll</TT
> (and
      many other PHP related files) exist in the PHP folder, you'll want to
      add the PHP folder to your systems PATH.

      If your MySQL libs are linked against pthreads this will happen. Check
      using ldd. If they are, grab the MySQL tarball and compile from source,
      or recompile from the source rpm and remove the switch in the spec file
      that turns on the threaded client code. Either of these suggestions will
      fix this. Then recompile PHP with the new MySQL libs.

      Why do I get an error that looks something like this:
      "Warning: 0 is not a MySQL result index in &#60;file&#62;
      on line &#60;x&#62;" or "Warning: Supplied argument is not

      You are trying to use a result identifier that is 0. The 0 indicates
      that your query failed for some reason. You need to check for errors
      after submitting a query and before you attempt to use the returned
      result identifier.  The proper way to do this is with code similar
      to the following:
      <TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
CELLPADDING="5"
><TR
><TD
><code><font color="#000000">
