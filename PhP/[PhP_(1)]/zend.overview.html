>&#13;   "Extending PHP" is easier said than done. PHP has evolved to a
   full-fledged tool consisting of a few megabytes of source code,
   and to hack a system like this quite a few things have to be
   learned and considered.  When structuring this chapter, we finally
   decided on the "learn by doing" approach. This is not the most
   scientific and professional approach, but the method that's the
   most fun and gives the best end results. In the following
   sections, you'll learn quickly how to get the most basic
   extensions to work almost instantly. After that, you'll learn
   about Zend's advanced API functionality. The alternative would
   have been to try to impart the functionality, design, tips,
   tricks, etc. as a whole, all at once, thus giving a complete look
   at the big picture before doing anything practical. Although this
   is the "better" method, as no dirty hacks have to be made, it can
   be very frustrating as well as energy- and time-consuming, which
   is why we've decided on the direct approach.

>&#13;   Note that even though this chapter tries to impart as much
   knowledge as possible about the inner workings of PHP, it's
   impossible to really give a complete guide to extending PHP that
   works 100% of the time in all cases. PHP is such a huge and
   complex package that its inner workings can only be understood if
   you make yourself familiar with it by practicing, so we encourage
   you to work with the source.

    Zend takes part 1 completely and a bit of part 2; PHP takes parts
    2 and 3. Together they form the complete PHP package. Zend itself
    really forms only the language core, implementing PHP at its very
    basics with some predefined functions. PHP contains all the
    modules that actually create the language's outstanding
    capabilities.
